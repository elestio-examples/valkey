- Our team performs quality control checks to ensure the products we release meet our high standards.

# Usage

## Git clone

You can deploy it easily with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/elestio-examples/valkey.git

Copy the .env file from tests folder to the project directory

    cp ./tests/.env ./.env

Edit the .env file with your own values.

Create data folders with correct permissions

    mkdir -p ./data
    chown -R 1000:1000 ./data

Run the project with the following command

    docker-compose up -d

You can connect to your server with any Valkey client:

    Host: your.domain
    Port: 6379
    Password: your-password

CLI:

    redis-cli -h your.domain -p 6379 -aÂ 'your-password'

Service URI:

    valkey://:your-password@your.domain:6379/0

## Docker-compose

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

    version: '3.3'
    services:
        valkey:
            image: elestio4test/valkey:${SOFTWARE_VERSION_TAG}
            command: redis-server --save 10 1 --loglevel warning --requirepass ${SOFTWARE_PASSWORD}
            shm_size: '1g'
            env_file:
                - .env
            volumes:
                - ./data:/data
            restart: always
            ports:
                - "172.17.0.1:6379:6379"

### Environment variables

|       Variable       | Value (example) |
| :------------------: | :-------------: |
| SOFTWARE_VERSION_TAG |     latest      |
|  SOFTWARE_PASSWORD   |  your-password  |

# Maintenance

## Logging

The Elestio Valkey Docker image sends the container logs to stdout. To view the logs, you can use the following command:

    docker-compose logs -f

To stop the stack you can use the following command:

    docker-compose down

## Backup and Restore with Docker Compose

To make backup and restore operations easier, we are using folder volume mounts. You can simply stop your stack with docker-compose down, then backup all the files and subfolders in the folder near the docker-compose.yml file.

Creating a ZIP Archive
For example, if you want to create a ZIP archive, navigate to the folder where you have your docker-compose.yml file and use this command:

    zip -r myarchive.zip .

Restoring from ZIP Archive
To restore from a ZIP archive, unzip the archive into the original folder using the following command:

    unzip myarchive.zip -d /path/to/original/folder

Starting Your Stack
Once your backup is complete, you can start your stack again with the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

That's it! With these simple steps, you can easily backup and restore your data volumes using Docker Compose.
